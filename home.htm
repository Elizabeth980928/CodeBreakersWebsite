                    <h1>Education</h1>
                    <p>Here at Mzamomstsha Primary we aim to create classrooms where young children can thrive and cultivate their minds. We allow children to explore their imaginations and express their minds, to develop strong bonds with their peers and help each other to be smarter kids. We believe that a strong leadership from staff and parents will help young children have good role models. By providing children with the necesssary tools and skills we believe we can mold a brighter future for South Africa.</p>

                    <h1>Sports</h1>
                    <p>At Mzamomtsha Primary we believe that consistent participation in sports and physical activity at a young age encourages positive cognitive development in children â€“ developing and learning to use the core skills of the brain to think, learn, remember, and problem solve. allows learners an opportunity to express themselves and connect with other people. The social benefits play a vital role in the development of a learner in society by teaching them how to participate in a team.</p>
