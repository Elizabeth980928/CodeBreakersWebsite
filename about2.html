                <p>Between the towns of Khayelistha and Umfuleni, in the Western Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa, is where Mzamomtsha Primary School is situated. Simphiwe Khuze, the school's headmaster, started working there in 2008. The school is situated in Drift Sands, a semi-township that was formerly an unofficial village. Since then, Drift Sands has been improved, and with assistance from the South African government, it has become a vast township with cutting-edge housing complexes. Mzamomtsha Primary School is an important part of Drift Sands and supports the neighborhood. </p>
